GHOST is a blogging platform with minimal use interface .
Here I have used two docker images to run two services that are ghost blogging server and mysql server
The docker YAML file is a file which contains the whole code to deploy the above service .
Just by one click we setup the infrastructure. It is one of the great example of IAAS(infrastructure as a service)
